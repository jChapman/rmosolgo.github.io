<div class="entry-content"><p>GraphQL-Ruby 1.9.0 introduces a new runtime called <code>GraphQL::Execution::Interpreter</code>. It offers better performance and some new features.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In <a href="https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/861#issuecomment-458533219">isolated benchmarks</a>, the new runtime is about 50% faster. We saw about a 10% speedup in GitHub when we migrated.</p>

<p>You can opt in by adding to your schema:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MySchema</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">GraphQL</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Schema</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># To skip preprocessing (you can use the interpreter without adding this)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">use</span> <span class="ss">GraphQL</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Analysis</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">AST</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But why rewrite?</p>

<h2>Problem 1: per-field context objects</h2>

<p>Previously, each field evaluated by GraphQL-Ruby got its own instance of <code>GraphQL::Query::Context::FieldResolutionContext</code>. This was introduced so that fields using <code>graphql-batch</code>-style Promises could reliably access context values (like <code>ctx.path</code>) <em>after</em> returning from the resolver (ie, when the promise was synced.)</p>

<p>The problem was, the bigger the response, the more <code>ctx</code> objects would be created &ndash; and most of the time (for example, plain scalar fields), they were never <em>used</em> by application code. So, we allocated, initialized, then GCed these objects for nothing!</p>

<p>In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t for <em>nothing</em>. As time passed, I started using those context objects inside execution code. For example, null propagation was implemented by climbing <em>up</em> the tree of context objects. So you couldn&rsquo;t just <em>stop</em> creating them &ndash; the runtime depended on them.</p>

<h3>Solution: one mutable context</h3>

<p>To remove this performance issue, I went <em>back</em> to creating a single <code>Query::Context</code> object and passing it to resolvers. If you&rsquo;re using the new class-based API, you might have noticed that <code>self.context</code> is a <code>Query::Context</code>, not a <code>Query::Context::FieldResolutionContext</code>. I did it this way to pave the way for removing this bottleneck.</p>

<p>But what about access to runtime information?</p>

<h3>Solution: explicit requests for runtime info</h3>

<p>For fields that <em>want</em> runtime info (like <code>path</code> or <code>ast_node</code>), they can opt into it with <code>extras: [...]</code>, for example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">field</span> <span class="ss">:items</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">,</span> <span class="ss">extras</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:path</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By adding that configuration, the requested value will be injected into the resolver:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">items</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">path</span><span class="p">:)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>path</code> will be a frozen Array describing the current point in the GraphQL response.</p>

<h3>Solution: reimplementing the runtime</h3>

<p>Finally, since <code>FieldResolutionContext</code>s aren&rsquo;t necessary for user code, we can rewrite execution to <em>not</em> create or use them anymore. Under the hood, <code>GraphQL::Execution::Interpreter</code> doesn&rsquo;t create those <code>ctx</code> objects. Instead, null propagation is implemented manually and all necessary values are passed from method to method.</p>

<h2>Problem 2: inefficient preprocessing</h2>

<p>Years ago, someone requested the feature of <em>rejecting a query before running it</em>. They wanted to analyze the incoming query, and if it was too big or too complicated, reject it.</p>

<p>How could this be implemented? You could provide user access to the AST, but that would leave some difficult processing to user code, for example, merging fragments on interfaces.</p>

<p>So, I added <code>GraphQL::InternalRepresentation</code> as a normalized, pre-processed query structure. Before running a query, the AST was transformed into a tree of <code>irep_node</code>s. Users could analyze that structure and reject queries if desired.</p>

<p>In execution code, why throw away the result of that preprocessing? The runtime also used <code>irep_node</code>s to save re-calculating fragment merging.</p>

<p>In fact, even <em>static validation</em> used the <code>irep_node</code> tree. At some point, rather than re-implement fragment merging, I decided to hook into that rewritten tree to implement <code>FragmentsWillMerge</code>. After all, why throw away that work?</p>

<p>(As it turns out, someone should fire the GraphQL-Ruby maintainer. These layers of code were <em>not</em> well-isolated!!)</p>

<h3>Problem 2.1: Preparing the <code>irep_node</code>s was slow and often a waste</h3>

<p>Since the <code>irep_node</code> tree was built for <em>analysis</em>, it generated branches for <em>every</em> possible combination of interfaces, objects, and unions. This meant that, even for a query returning very simple data, the pre-processing step might be <em>very</em> complex.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the complexity of this preprocessing would grow as the schema grew. The more implementers an interface has, the longer it takes to calculate the possible branches in a fragment.</p>

<h3>Problem 2.2: Runtime features were implemented during preprocessing</h3>

<p>Not only was the work complex, but it also couldn&rsquo;t be cached. This is because, while building the <code>irep_node</code> tree, <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> would be evaluated with the current query variables. If nodes were skipped, they were left out of the <code>irep_node</code> tree.</p>

<p>This means that, for the <em>same</em> query in your code base, you <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> reuse the <code>irep_node</code> tree, since the values for those query variables might be different from one execution to the next. Boo, hiss!</p>

<h3>Problem 2.3: A wacky preprocessing step is hard to understand</h3>

<p>I want to empower people to use GraphQL-Ruby in creative ways, but throwing a wacky, custom data structure in the mix doesn&rsquo;t make it easy. I think an easier execution model will encourage people to learn how it works and build cool new stuff!</p>

<h3>Solution: No preprocessing</h3>

<p>The new runtime evaluates the AST directly. Runtime features (<code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code>, for example) are implemented at, well, <em>runtime</em>!</p>

<h3>Solution: AST Analyzers</h3>

<p>Since you can&rsquo;t use the <code>irep_node</code> tree for analysis anymore, the library includes a new module, <code>GraphQL::Analysis::AST</code>, for preprocessing queries. Shout out to <a href="https://github.com/xuorig">@xuorig</a> for this module!</p>

<h3>Solution: Moving ahead-of-time checks to runtime</h3>

<p>For GitHub, we moved a lot of analyzer behavior to runtime. We did this because it&rsquo;s easier to maintain and requires less GraphQL-specific knowledge to understand and modify. Although the client experience is <em>slightly</em> different, it&rsquo;s still good.</p>

<p>For example, we had an analyzer to check that pagination parameters (eg <code>first</code> and <code>last</code>) were valid. We moved this to runtime, adding it to our connection tooling.</p>

<h3>Solution: <code>GraphQL::Execution::Lookahead</code></h3>

<p><code>irep_node</code>s <em>were</em> useful for looking ahead in a query to see what fields would be selected next. (Honestly, they weren&rsquo;t <em>that good</em>, but they were the only thing we had, beside using the AST directly).</p>

<p>To support that use, we now have <code>extras: [:lookahead]</code> which will inject an instance of <code>GraphQL::Execution::Lookahead</code>, with an API <em>explicitly for</em> checking fields later in the query.</p>

<h2>Other considerations</h2>

<h3>Resolve procs are out</h3>

<p>As part of the change with removing <code>FieldResolutionContext</code>, the new runtime doesn&rsquo;t support proc-style resolvers <code>-&gt;(obj, args, ctx) {...}</code>. Besides <code>ctx</code>, the <code>args</code> objects (<code>GraphQL::Query::Arguments</code>) are not created by the interpreter either. Instead, the interpreter uses plain hashes.</p>

<p>Instead of procs, methods on Object type classes should be used.</p>

<p>This means that proc-based features are also not supported. Field instrumenters and middlewares won&rsquo;t be called; a new feature called field extensions should be used instead.</p>

<h3><code>.to_graphql</code> is <em>almost</em> out</h3>

<p>When the class-based schema API was added to GraphQL-Ruby, there was a little problem. The class-based API was great for developers, but the execution API expected legacy-style objects. The bridge was crossed via a compatibility layer: each type class had a <code>def self.to_graphql</code> method which returned a legacy-style object based on that class. Internally, the class and legacy object were cached together.</p>

<p>The interpreter <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> use those legacy objects, only classes. So, any type extensions that you&rsquo;ve built will have to be supported on those <em>classes</em>.</p>

<p>The catch is, I&rsquo;m not <em>100% sure</em> that uses of legacy objects have all been migrated. In GitHub, we transitioned by delegating methods from the legacy objects to their source classes, and I haven&rsquo;t removed those delegations yet. So, there might still be uses of legacy objects 😅.</p>

<p>In a future version, I want to remove the use of those objects <em>completely</em>!</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I hope this post has clarified some of the goals and approaches toward adding the new runtime. I&rsquo;m already building new features for it, like custom directives and better subscription support.
