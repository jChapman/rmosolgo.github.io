My name is Robert Mosolgo and I work as a Ruby/Rails and JavaScript developer at [Ministry Centered Technologies](http://get.planningcenteronline.com) in Carlsbad, California. My wife, [Valerie](https://twitter.com/vwmos), and I moved to Carlsbad in 2013, but we both grew up in Charlottesville, Virginia.

I attended the College of William and Mary and studied Chinese Studies, but fell in love with web programming while working at [AidData](http://aiddata.org).

I don't really have much of an eye for style, which is why this blog is so ugly.
