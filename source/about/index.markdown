My name is Robert Mosolgo and I work as a Ruby/Rails and JavaScript developer at [Planning Center Online](http://get.planningcenteronline.com) in Carlsbad, California. My wife and I live in Charlottesville, Virginia.

I attended the College of William and Mary and studied Chinese Studies, but fell in love with web programming while working at [AidData](http://aiddata.org).
