My name is Robert Mosolgo and I work as a Ruby/Rails and JavaScript developer at [Ministry Centered Technologies](http://get.planningcenteronline.com) in Carlsbad, California. My wife, [Valerie](https://twitter.com/vwmos), and I moved to Carlsbad in 2013, but we both grew up in Charlottesville, Virginia.

I attended the College of William and Mary and studied Chinese Studies, but fell in love with web programming -- especially the Ruby on Rails variety -- while working at [AidData](http://aiddata.org).

I don't really have much of an eye for style, which is why this blog is so ugly. I'm a fanboy, documenter, and sometimes-contributor to [batman.js](http://batmanjs.org).

I write about:

- [Ruby](/blog/categories/ruby/)
- [Rails](/blog/categories/rails/)
- [JavaScript](/blog/categories/javascript/) and [CoffeeScript](/blog/categories/coffeescript/)
- [Batman.js](/blog/categories/batman-dot-js/)
