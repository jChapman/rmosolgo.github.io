## About


My name is Robert Mosolgo and I work as a Ruby/Rails and JavaScript developer at [Ministry Centered Technologies](http://get.planningcenteronline.com).

This blog is ugly but I might get around to sprucing it up at some point.

My favorite toys are:

- [Ruby](/blog/categories/ruby/)
- [Rails](/blog/categories/rails/)
- [JavaScript](/blog/categories/javascript/) and [CoffeeScript](/blog/categories/coffeescript/)
- [Batman.js](/blog/categories/batman-dot-js/)
