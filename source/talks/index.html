  - title: "Testing Your Code"
    given_at: "Full Stack North County, October 8, 2015"
    tagline: "Testing will make you happy!"
    synopsis: "Meet the basic ideas of unit testing. A good test suite makes your life easier: you write less bugs and you can modify code more confidently. Testing pain also reveals design flaws, so testing-as-you-go is a good approach!"

  - title: "Flux: React Goes Big"
    given_at: "Full Stack North County, March 12, 2015"
    tagline: "Flux as a macrocosm of React's one-way data flow."
    synopsis: "One thing I love about React.js is how its one-way data flow provides simplicity and clarity to components. Flux has the same advantage: it brings one-way data flow to your application architecture. I describe key concepts in Flux in terms of analogous concepts in React."

  - title: "Ruby"
    given_at: "Full Stack North County, November 13, 2014"
    tagline: "A conceptual introduction to the Ruby language."
    synopsis: "Ruby is fun and powerful because it puts you in charge. You can inspect and modify your program at runtime. Also, we explore mruby (a Ruby implementation with a small footprint) and how we can connect C code and Ruby code."
