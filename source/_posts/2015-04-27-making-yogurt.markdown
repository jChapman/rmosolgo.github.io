This weekend I tried making yogurt. It worked!

<!-- more -->

I based it on this great recipe: [Dr. David Fankhauser's Yogurt](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/yogurt_making/YOGURT2000.htm). Dr. Fankhauser has a [ton of illustrated, detailed recipes](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/CHEESE.html) for other dairy and make-at home foods (eg, [blue cheese](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Blue_Cheese/Blue_Cheese.htm), [maple syrup](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Buds_and_Bark/tapping_sugar_maple_index.html), [microwave popcorn](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/homesteading/popcorn_index.html)).

Some overall notes:

- My grocery store _doesn't carry_ plain yogurt (except in giant containers), so I used __greek yogurt as starter__. It worked just fine.
- The recipe called for 3 hours of culturing time, but I found __longer (12-16 hours) was better__.
- I really fretted over the incubation temperature. I don't think that was necessary. I think __set-it-and-forget-it would have been OK__!
- The resulting yogurt is as __good__ as you can get at the store!
- I'm also looking forward to using the __whey__ (pickles, ginger ale, ricotta cheese).


## The Setup

First, scald the milk to kill any unwanted cultures that may have survived pasteurization:

Sterilize equipment in boiling water:

Unwanted cultures could give the yogurt a bad taste.

## Incubation

Mix a cup of store-bought yogurt into the milk, then distribute it into jars.

Put the jars in a cooler with 120°F (50°C) water:

And let it sit:

I found longer was better. My longest was 16 hours and looked thick and good!

I was really fretting about the temperature: I occassionally scooped some water out, boiled it, then added it back. I think this was overkill!

## Result

In the jar, the curds and whey separate:

The whey can be decanted:

(This is whey from a few jars of yogurt.)

Leaving only the yogurt curd:

Yum! Smooth and creamy (after stirring), but unsweetened, so I add [hagelslag](http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/03/06/hagelslag/):

## Next

I'm looking forward to using the "leftover" whey to make:

- [whey pickles](http://immigrantstable.com/2013/11/17/whey-pickles/)
- [ginger ale](http://www.instructables.com/id/Lacto-fermented-Ginger-Ale/)
- [ricotta](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Ricotta/ricotta_00.htm) (also from Dr. Fankhauser)

Also, in a few weeks I'll try to step up my game and try [Dr. Fankhauser's neufchatel](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/neufchatel/neufchatel.htm), which adds rennet to the mix.
