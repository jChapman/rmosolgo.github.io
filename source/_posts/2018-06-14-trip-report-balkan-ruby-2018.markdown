This May, I had the opportunity to attend [Balkan Ruby](https://balkanruby.com/) and present on my work with [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby).

Here are a few thoughts about the trip.

## The Conference

Balkan Ruby was a big hit. Personally, some of my favorites were:

- Zach Holman's opening talk about datetimes and timezones (which became a [blog post](https://zachholman.com/talk/utc-is-enough-for-everyone-right) and inspired a [GraphQL-Ruby ISO8601 scalar type](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/pull/1566))
- Sameer Deshmukh's presentation about various [SciRuby](https://github.com/sciruby) projects
- Marko BogdanoviÄ‡'s talk about [RubyBench](https://rubybench.org/), which was a really cool project and made me want something like it for GraphQL-Ruby.

One of my favorite parts of the conference was the code challenges set up by [Receipt Bank](), one of the sponsors.

Every few hours, a new, wacky challenge would go live. Although I didn't do well on them, I enjoyed working with a few new friends on different solutions, and seeing the creative things that other attendees submitted!

## The City

Sofia was __great__. A beautiful city with interesting architecture, tons of trees and tasty food.

The Nevski Cathedral was built in the early 1900s to celebrate Russia's liberation of Bulgaria from the Ottomans:

Inside, a mural of Abraham and Isaac:

And St. Cyril and St. Methodius, creators of the Cyrillic alphabet, who are quite popular around here:

I really enjoyed the different cathedrals. There's something cool about the different instructive artwork and "sacred" feeling of a beautiful building with incense burning. I wonder if modern American churches could do more to engage all of our senses.

Also, a bit of Soviet history found in a nearby park:

And here, some recently excavated Roman ruins, and the one remaining Turkish mosque downtown:

The mosque was right beside ruins of an old bathhouse. Apparently that's why Sofia was founded here -- there were hot springs on the road between Rome and Constantinople, so the Romans set up camp (and called it Serdica).

And a fairly typical meal during my time there, a _shopska_ salad (veggies with cheese, oil, and vinegar):

I can't say enough good things about the local dairy products. The cheese was soft and fresh and the yogurt was tart and refreshing.

## The Organizers

My favorite part about programming conferences is meeting the smart, caring folks who make them possible, and Balkan Ruby was no exception.

The two main organizers, [Genadi](https://twitter.com/gsamokovarov) and [Vestimir](https://twitter.com/vestimir) were fantastic hosts (and experienced, since they got their start with Euruko a few years back). Besides that, I really enjoyed meeting the volunteers and learning a bit about life in Sofia.

One thing that stood out to me was the tradition behind the local liquor, rakia. It turns out that many families make it themselves, despite a law against owning stills. I've been reading that peach wine was the traditional alcoholic drink for the earliest European arrivals to my area, so I decided to give it a shot this summer!

A big bonus was when Vestimir played trail guide for our hike up the nearby mountain, Mt. Vitosha. It turned out to be a gray day, but we had a blast anyways.

Some pictures of the trail:

Beautiful! But you could say were were _a bit_ underdressed XD

At the summit, we were happy to find a lodge where some food was served.

Some traditional bean soup, bread, [lyutenitsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljutenica), cheese tea, and rakia never tasted so good.

Enjoying a rest:

And, pleasantly, we caught a nice view of Sofia on the way back down:

## Closing Thoughts

Balkan Ruby was a big hit on all fronts: great people, great city, great technical content. Especially as a dairy lover, I'll take the next chance I get to go back! And I loved making some new friends, who I hope to see at future Ruby events.
